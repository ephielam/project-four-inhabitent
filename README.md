First attempt at using Wordpress as a content management system

Major obstacles:
- Generating the Find Us form without Contact Form 7 plug in 
- Using jQuery to display search input field upon search icon click

Future work:
- Split styling into separate scss files
- Stretch goals:
    - 'Adventures' custom post type and archive template
    - Custom screenshot for theme
    - Use jQuery to alter the style of header to be absolutely positioned with a reverse colour scheme on pages with hero images at the top and transition to the standard site header once the user has scrolledpast the hero image to the rest of the page content
